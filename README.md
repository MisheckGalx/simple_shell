# ALX Simple Shell


ALX Simple Shell is a custom Unix-like command-line shell that was developed as part of the ALX Software Engineering program. It provides a simple and extensible environment for running shell commands and managing processes.

## Features

- **Command Execution**: Execute system and custom commands just like a standard shell.
- **Piping and Redirection**: Support for piping and redirection of command input and output.
- **Environment Variables**: Manage environment variables and access them in your shell.
- **Custom Commands**: Extend the shell with your own custom commands.
- **Job Control**: Manage background processes and jobs.
- **Interactive and Batch Modes**: Run the shell interactively or execute scripts in batch mode.
